# Resume Align AI ü§ñ

An AI-powered career coach, built in Python, designed to demystify the job application process by providing a deep, actionable analysis of your resume against a job description.

---

### About The Project

This project started with a simple question every job seeker asks: **"Am I the right candidate for this role?"**

This project was created with a focus on **simplicity and transparency**. While many powerful platforms and complex open-source projects exist, the goal here wasn't to replicate all their features. Instead, this tool is **intentionally streamlined** to be easy to set up and run, allowing anyone to explore the **core mechanics** of how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to resume analysis. Given its academic purpose and origin as a personal job-seeking tool, the prompt engineering is **specifically fine-tuned for software engineering roles, including Full-stack Developer, DevOps and related developer positions.**

It's about more than just tweaking a resume for a single application; it‚Äôs about creating a feedback loop for continuous professional improvement.

### Features ‚ú®

* üìä **Detailed Match Score:** Instantly see where you stand with a comprehensive score.
* üå± **Actionable Skill Gaps:** Know exactly what skills to work on to become a better fit.
* üöÄ **Learning Potential Rating:** Highlights your ability to adapt and grow into the role, even if you don't meet 100% of the requirements.
* ü§ñ **ATS-Compatibility Check:** Get concrete tips to ensure your resume gets past the bots and is seen by a human.
* ü¶Ñ **Job Description Analysis:** Get a deep dive into the job requirements, identifying key responsibilities and core/desirable requirements.

### Tech Stack & Core Mechanics üõ†Ô∏è

The "secret sauce" of this application is a combination of a modern tech stack and strategic implementation:

* **Backend:** Python
* **AI Engine:** OpenAI API (specifically `gpt-4o-mini` for its balance of cost and capability).
* **Core Logic:** Strategic Prompt Engineering to guide the AI's reasoning for a deep, relevant analysis.
* **Data Integrity:** Strict data schemas enforced by Pydantic to ensure clean, predictable JSON output every time.
